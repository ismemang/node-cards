// Create a standard 52 card deck + 2 jokers
const deck = new decks.StandardDeck({ jokers: 2 });

// Shuffle the deck
deck.shuffleAll();

// Draw a hand of five cards from the deck
const hand = deck.draw(5);

// Pull 2 cards out of the hand to exchange
const toExchange = hand.splice(2, 2);

// Discard those 2 cards
deck.discard(toExchange);

// Draw 2 new ones from the deck
hand.push(...deck.draw(2));
```

#### Custom Randomization Source

```typescript
import { RandomGenerator, decks } from 'cards';

// Create a new RandomGenerator implementation
class MyRNG implements RandomGenerator {
  // The `int` method should return a random integer between 0 and `max`
  int(max: number) : number {
    return (Math.random() * max) | 0;
  }
}

// You can pass an instance of RNG implemenation to any `Deck` class, and
// it will be used for any randomization requiring tasks (i.e. shuffling)
const deck = new decks.StandardDeck({ rng: new MyRNG() });
```

### TODO
